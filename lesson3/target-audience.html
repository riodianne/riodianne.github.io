                        <p>Naomi and Lara are sisters who have planned a vacation trip in Bohol, Philippines. They have been planning this trip for over a month now and been thinking to what kinds of clothing should they wear as well as what kinds of activites should they plan. Bohol's weather is not stable for the past few months, sometimes it's very sunny and some days are rainy.

                        <p>The track and field participants have their 10 days straight training for Regional Competition. The coaches have been wondering whether to have their usual practice in the open field or have their training in the covered court instead.</p>

                            Will it be windy or just a normal day? Students will wear jeans or skirt going to school?

                        <li>
                            At nighttime, will stargazers wait for amazing constellations or it will be a rainy night?
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            At 6:00 in the morning, it is cold and raining very hard. Will the students still go to school or their classes are suspended?
